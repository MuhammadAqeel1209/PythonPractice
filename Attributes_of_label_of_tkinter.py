\nFriendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people.
\nIt is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an "acquaintance" or an "association", such as a classmate, neighbor, coworker, or colleague.
\nIn some cultures, the concept of friendship is restricted to a small number of very deep relationships; \nin others, such as the U.S. and Canada, a person could have many friends,\n and perhaps a more intense relationship with one or two people, who may be called good friends or best friends.
